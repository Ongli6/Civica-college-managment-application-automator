# Civica-college-managment-application-automator

Application helper - scrapes data from Student BIO and completes application flowchart based on it. We complete hundreds of applications a day by hand - in theory automating the process would save us at least 2 hrs a day *EACH*. 

Consists of two main sections - Function dictionary containing each step of application process and Controller. FE process is the only process pathway it can handle at the moment however structure was deliberate in order to allow sequence of functions executed to be be re-ordered in the controller to allow for application in other process pathways such as LLD or short course offer.
